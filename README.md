# Analyse-User-Behaviour


Here, we analyse the User Behaviour by Integrating Analytics into our Application. Using the Telemetry data and the number of corrections that users have been suggested, we should be able to predict the most common points of error and optimise the user workflow. Using this data, we need to intimate the UX team about the screens/actions that might need some improvement.
